# 🛰️ Satellite Image Land Use Classification

A CNN-powered deep learning project that classifies satellite images into different land use categories such as **urban**, **forest**, **water**, and **agriculture**. Built with an interactive **Streamlit** frontend for real-time inference and visualization.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

- 🔍 **Objective**: Identify land use types in satellite imagery using deep learning.
- 🛠️ **Approach**: Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on satellite image data to classify terrain.
- 🌍 **Impact**: Supports **urban planning**, **environmental monitoring**, and **deforestation analysis** with automated, fast, and accurate image classification.
- 🎛️ **Interface**: A Streamlit-based web app allows users to upload satellite images and instantly receive predictions.
